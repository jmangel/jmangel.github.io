      <p>Hello world! My name is John Mangel, I'm a Computer Science and Linguistics undergraduate at UC Santa Barbara. This is my code portfolio, hosted with GitHub Pages. My primary focus in computer science right now is software developement. <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-mangel-a5a056a8>Click here to go to my LinkedIn account.</a></p>

      <h3>Digital Linguistics</h3>
      <p>My most recent project is with some linguistics faculty and graduates at my school, <strong>UCSB</strong>, writing browser-based software for linguistics researchers to aid in tracking research data. In addition to contributing to the big-picture design discussions, one of my biggest coding tasks was to create a page of the website to demonstrate the basic function of our data structure, using mostly Javascript and the Intro.js library. <a href=introdemo.html>Click here to see the demonstration.</a></p>
      <p>I built this demo using an open-source Javascript library called <a href=http://usablica.github.io/intro.js/>Intro.js</a>, which allows developers to show their website's features using a step-by-step tutorial. This demonstration will also show you the basic idea of the data structure that my team built. We've since been working on building a database with an API and an SDK for Javascript developers who want to create their own apps using our data structure.</p>
