      <p>Hello world! This is my code portfolio, hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
      <p>My most recent project is with some linguistics faculty and graduates at my school, UCSB, writing browser-based software for linguistics researchers to aid in tracking research data. In addition to big-picture design, one of my biggest contributions was writing the JavaScript code to demonstrate the basic idea of our data structure using the intro.js library.
