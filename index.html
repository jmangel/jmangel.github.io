      <h3>Linguistic research data tracking</h3>
      <p>My most recent project is with some linguistics faculty and graduates at my school, <strong>UCSB</strong>, writing browser-based software for linguistics researchers to aid in tracking research data. In addition to big-picture design, one of my biggest contributions was writing the <strong>JavaScript</strong> code to demonstrate the basic idea of our data structure using the intro.js library.</p>
