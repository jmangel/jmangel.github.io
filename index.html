      <p class="intro">Hello world! My name is John Mangel, I'm an undergraduate studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Linguistics with a German emphasis</strong> at <strong>UC Santa Barbara</strong>. This is my code portfolio, hosted with GitHub Pages. My primary focus in computer science is application developement.</p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>Digital Linguistics</h3>
      <p>Recently I've been working on a project with some linguistics faculty and graduate students at UCSB, writing browser-based software for linguistics researchers to aid in tracking research data. In addition to contributing to the big-picture design discussions, one of my biggest coding tasks was to create a webpage to demonstrate the basic function of our data structure, using primarily Javascript and the Intro.js library. <a href=introdemo.html><strong>Click here to see the demonstration</strong>.</a></p>
      <p>I built this demo using an open-source Javascript library called <a href=http://usablica.github.io/intro.js/>Intro.js</a>, which allows developers to show their website's features using a step-by-step tutorial. This demonstration will also show you the basic idea of the data structure that my team built. We've since been working on building a database with an API and a Javascript SDK for developers who want to create their own apps using our data structure.</p>

      <h3>Zombie Run IV</h3>
      <p>In this past quarter, I spent two months creating a game as part of a five-man team of computer science undergraduates. The game is called Zombie Run IV, and it is an infinite runner game set in our college town of Isla Vista. We built this game using the game engine Unity, writing scripts in C# and using a Heroku database to store settings and leaderboards. To try this game, find the download links for Windows and Mac <a href=http://zombie-run-iv.herokuapp.com/>here</a>, extract the zip folder, and run build.exe on Windows or ZombieRunIV.app on Mac.</p>
