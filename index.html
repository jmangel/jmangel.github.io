      <p class="intro">Hello world! My name is John Mangel, I'm an undergraduate studying <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Linguistics with a German emphasis</strong> at <strong>UC Santa Barbara</strong>. This is my code portfolio, hosted with GitHub Pages. My primary focus in computer science is application developement.</p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>Digital Linguistics</h3>
      <p>My most recent project is with some linguistics faculty and graduates at my school, UCSB, writing browser-based software for linguistics researchers to aid in tracking research data. In addition to contributing to the big-picture design discussions, one of my biggest coding tasks was to create a page of the website to demonstrate the basic function of our data structure, using mostly Javascript and the Intro.js library. <a href=introdemo.html><strong>Click here to see the demonstration</strong>.</a></p>
      <p>I built this demo using an open-source Javascript library called <a href=http://usablica.github.io/intro.js/>Intro.js</a>, which allows developers to show their website's features using a step-by-step tutorial. This demonstration will also show you the basic idea of the data structure that my team built. We've since been working on building a database with an API and a Javascript SDK for developers who want to create their own apps using our data structure.</p>
